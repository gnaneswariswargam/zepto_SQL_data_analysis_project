## üß† Key Objectives

- Identify high-demand product categories
- Analyze price vs discount strategy
- Find products that frequently go out of stock
- Calculate total revenue and average order values
- Segment customers based on purchase behavior

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **PostgreSQL** (v17)
- **pgAdmin**
- **SQL** (Joins, Aggregations, Window Functions, Subqueries)
- *(Optional)* Excel for basic visualization

## üîç Sample SQL Queries

```sql
-- Total sales by category
SELECT product_category, 
 SUM(quantity * discountedSellingPrice) AS total_revenue
FROM zepto
GROUP BY product_category
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

-- Out of stock products
SELECT product_name, availableQuantity
FROM zepto
WHERE outOfStock = true;

üìà Key Insights
Beverages and Snacks are the top revenue-generating categories.
A few products had stockouts repeatedly ‚Äî impacting sales.
Average discount offered was around 12.5%, with some outliers.
High-value customers tend to shop during weekends.

üßæ Conclusion
This project helped practice SQL skills on a real-world-like dataset by generating business insights from raw transactional data. It‚Äôs a good fit for those learning data analytics or preparing for SQL interviews.
